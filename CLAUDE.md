# Blog CMS — Claude Code Instructions

## Overview

This is a lightweight CMS for managing AI-generated blog posts. Built with React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS 4, and Supabase.

- **Directory:** `~/realtor-blog-cms/` (rename to match your project)
- **Supabase project:** Uses the same Supabase instance as the main website
- **Dev server:** `cd ~/realtor-blog-cms && npm run dev`

## "CMS" as Context Keyword

When the user references **"CMS"** in conversation, it means this blog CMS and its Supabase tables. Use Supabase MCP to read/write data.

## Tables

## Topic Pipeline Workflows

### Saving researched topics → "put topics in the CMS"

When the user asks you to save researched topics to the CMS:

1. Use Supabase MCP to INSERT into `blog_topics`
2. Populate all typed columns: title, primary_keyword, secondary_keywords, search_volume, keyword_difficulty, cpc, competition_level
3. Build `research_data` JSONB following the structure below
4. Set status to `'researched'`

### Writing approved topics → "write the approved topics from the CMS"

When the user asks you to write approved topics:

1. Query `blog_topics` WHERE `status = 'approved'`
2. For each topic, use `research_data` as the SEO brief to guide writing
3. Write the blog post content as a JSONB array of content blocks
4. INSERT the blog post into `blog_posts` with status `'draft'`
5. UPDATE the topic: set `status = 'written'` and `blog_post_id = <new post id>`

### Checking for changes → "I made changes in the CMS"

When the user says they made changes in the CMS:

1. Query `blog_topics` ordered by `updated_at DESC` (limit 10) to see recent changes
2. Also check `blog_posts` if the user mentions blog changes
3. Report what changed (status updates, new notes, etc.)

## research_data JSONB Structure

Always save research data in this format for consistency:

```json
{
  "competitor_analysis": [
    {
      "domain": "example.com",
      "what_they_cover": "...",
      "what_they_miss": "..."
    }
  ],
  "content_gaps": [
    "Gap 1 description",
    "Gap 2 description"
  ],
  "ai_search_presence": {
    "summary": "How LLMs currently cover this topic",
    "mentions_our_site": false,
    "top_mentioned_domains": ["domain1.com", "domain2.com"]
  },
  "serp_overview": {
    "top_results_summary": "What's ranking and content type",
    "content_types": ["article", "video", "local_pack"],
    "featured_snippets": true
  },
  "suggested_angles": [
    "Angle 1 — why it works for our audience",
    "Angle 2 — differentiation opportunity"
  ],
  "full_brief": "Complete markdown SEO brief including all of the above in readable format"
}
```

## Content Block Types (for blog_posts.content)

When writing blog posts, use these JSONB block types:

- `{ "type": "paragraph", "text": "..." }`
- `{ "type": "heading", "text": "..." }`
- `{ "type": "subheading", "text": "..." }`
- `{ "type": "list", "items": ["item1", "item2"] }`
- `{ "type": "process-steps", "steps": [{ "title": "...", "text": "..." }] }`
- `{ "type": "callout", "title": "...", "text": "..." }`
- `{ "type": "quote", "text": "...", "author": "..." }`
- `{ "type": "info-box", "title": "...", "text": "...", "variant": "blue|warning" }`
- `{ "type": "image", "src": "...", "alt": "...", "caption": "..." }`
- `{ "type": "table", "headers": ["..."], "rows": [["...", "..."]] }`
- `{ "type": "stat-cards", "items": [{ "label": "...", "value": "..." }] }`
- `{ "type": "pros-cons", "pros": ["..."], "cons": ["..."] }`

## Prompt Block Type

The `prompt` block type is a special instruction block for Claude. It appears in the editor with a violet dashed border and is NOT rendered on the public site. Use it to leave instructions within the content for Claude to process.

- `{ "type": "prompt", "text": "Generate a comparison table of flood insurance costs by zone..." }`

## Revalidation

When `VITE_REVALIDATE_URL` is set in `.env`, the CMS will POST to that URL after saving a published post. This triggers ISR cache refresh on the public site so changes appear immediately.

For Next.js sites, set this to: `https://yourdomain.com/admin/api/revalidate`
